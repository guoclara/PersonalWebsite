            Hi! My name is Clara Guo. I'm a senior studying Applied Math-Computer Science at Brown Univeristy and am graduating in May 2023. I'm looking for an opportunity to start my professional career as a software engineer.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            I am passionate about creating technology that touches a wide audience and makes their lives better in some way, whether that's through providing entertainment through streaming or through helping local communities with their tech needs.
            <br></br>
            <br></br> 
            Take a look at the rest of the website, and please contact me if you have any questions!
            My socials, email, resume and github can be found on the bar to the right of the home page</p>
          </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

class Website extends React.Component {
  render () {
    return(
      <div className = "website">
        <About />
        <ExpPage />
        <ProjPage />
        <MoreInfo />
       
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Website />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
