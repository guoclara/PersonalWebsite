My name is Clara Guo. I'm a sophomore studying Applied Math-Computer Science at Brown Univeristy.\n            I'm extremely passionate about understanding how to take data and information in the world and\n            making it easier for everyone to understand, especially when it comes to pushing for social change.\n            <br></br>\n            <br></br>\n            Trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life, I came across this article describing how math professors testified on the likelihood \n            that the majority party gerrymandered their voting districts and how they were able to provide evidence arguing that it \n            was nearly certain they had. I want to take advantage of the potential STEM has to transform society and communities.\n            <br></br>\n            <br></br>\n            I'm driven by this desire and it translates to what I do and how I do it. I'm someone who thinks\n            on their feet and isn't afraid of failing. I'm proactive, self-motivated, creative and collaborative. I'm able to \n            practice this in my academic career as well as my hobbies, some of which include playing soccer, cooking, and whittling. \n            I always want to learn more, whether that means teaching myself how to carve block prints or learning html to make this website.\n            <br></br>\n            <br></br>\n            Take a look at the rest of the website, and please contact me if you have any questions!\n            My socials, email, resume and github can be found on the bar on the right of the home page</p>\n          </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nclass Website extends React.Component {\n  render () {\n    return(\n      <div className = \"website\">\n        <About />\n        <ExpPage />\n        <ProjPage />\n        <MoreInfo />\n       \n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <Website />,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/initials.a084b342.png\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/profile.6c690bf3.png\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
