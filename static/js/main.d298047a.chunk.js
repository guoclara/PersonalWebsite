Tutors are paired in a teacher's class and help students twice a week. STEMS aims to offer extra help to teachers, provide academic support, and act as mentors for students, and to support a greater self-efficacy for students in STEM fields. As part of the Tutor Development Team, I am responsible for recruiting tutors, community building and meeting planning, running social media, and gathering feedback.","San Diego Pride is a nonprofit that aims to foster pride, equality, and respect for the LGBT community. In addition to holding an annual Pride Parade and Festival, SD Pride is one of the only pride organizations that provides year-round education and advocacy programs. As the Programs Intern, I created, edited, and reviewed content and documents for live programming, organization coalitions, and volunteer resources. I helped manage speakers at livestream events as well as fundraise and moderate social media. With our streamed events, we were able to broaden our reach across the globe, including to those not out and those in countries where there is heavy stigma or homosexuality is criminalized.","ACLU's Brown University Chapter seeks to raise awareness around civil liberties issues. Each semester, new working groups dedicated to various civil issues are created. I was a part of the Immigrants' Rights Working Group and we sought to clarify the financial aid and college application process for undocumented/DACA students. I designed a page long infographic representing the culmination of research and interviews of relevant university staff. I also created the new branding for all Brown ACLU social media and am currently designing their website layout.","La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company develops and commercializes innovative therapies that improve outcomes in patients suffering from life-threatening diseases. In December 2017, GIAPREZA\u2122 (angiotensin II) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat adults with septic or other distributive shock. Using R Studio and Excel, I extractred, organized, merged, and analyzed pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data from clinical trials for toxicology reports.

Lab work done with the assistance of TAs.","Comprehensive introduction to ordinary differential equations and their applications. Demonstrated how applied mathematicians use ordinary differential equations to solve practical applications, from understanding the underlying problem, creating a differential-equations model, solving the model using analytical, numerical, or qualitative methods, and interpreting the findings in terms of the original problem. We will also learn about the underlying rigorous theoretical foundations of differential equations.","Deep leaning, plus the specialized techniques that it has inspired (e.g. convolutional features and word embeddings) have lead to rapid improvements in many applications such as computer vision, machine translation, and computer Go. This course intends to give students a practical understanding of deep learning as applied in these and other areas. It also teaches the Tensorflow programming language for the expression of deep leaning algorithms. (The primary API for Tensorflow is from Python.)","High-level computer architecture and systems programming. The course covers the organization of computer systems (in terms of storage units, caches, processors, and I/O controllers) and teaches students assembly-language programming and C-language programming.
