Each semester, new working groups dedicated to various civil issues are created. I was a part of the Immigrants' Rights Working Group and we sought to clarify the financial aid and college application process for undocumented/DACA students. I designed a page long infographic representing the culmination of research and interviews of relevant university staff. I also created the new branding for all Brown ACLU social media.","La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company develops and commercializes innovative therapies that improve outcomes in patients suffering from life-threatening diseases.
