In December 2017, GIAPREZA\u2122 (angiotensin II) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat adults with septic or other distributive shock. Using R Studio and Excel, I extractred, organized, merged, and analyzed pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data from clinical trials for toxicology reports. I charted macrophage levels in the blood at different dosages and times to help determine efficacy of drugs in development. I then presented and explained the graphs in internal meetings","All Girls STEM Society is a student run nonprofit that aims to empower young girls to pursue STEM through various free events (e.g. outreach, math tournaments) and workshops.

Focus on software testing, relational databases, and concurrency techniques. A major component of the course was a group software project of your own design.","Examination of probability theory and mathematical statistics from the perspective of computing. Topics include random number generation, Monte Carlo methods, importance sampling, Bayesian networks, dimensionality reduction. Homework done in MATLAB.","Selected topics about the mathematics of graphs with an emphasis on random graph models, the dynamics of processes operating on these graphs (percolation, cascades, epidemics, queuing, synchronization), and their application to biological, social, and technological networks.","Deep learning course plus the specialized techniques that it has inspired (e.g. convolutional features and word embeddings). Coursework includes creating different neural networks (e.g. convolutional, recurrent, n-gram) for image and natural language processing using Numpy and Tensorflow, reinforcement learning, and GANs.","This course treats vision as inference from noisy and uncertain data and emphasizes probabilistic and statistical approaches. Topics include object recognition, 3D reconstruction, feature recognition, and deep learning.","The course covers the organization of computer systems, assembly-language programming, and C-language programming.
