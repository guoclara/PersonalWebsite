Contexts include first order equations; the second order wave equation and problems involving diffusion processes; steady state balances for systems in two or three dimensions; together with insights from theory.","Comprehensive introduction to ordinary differential equations and their applications. Demonstrated how applied mathematicians use ordinary differential equations to solve practical applications, from understanding the underlying problem, creating a differential-equations model, solving the model using analytical, numerical, or qualitative methods, and interpreting the findings in terms of the original problem. We will also learn about the underlying rigorous theoretical foundations of differential equations.","An integrated first course in mathematical statistics. Covered probability and statistics, integrated with its probabilistic foundation. Specific topics include probability spaces, discrete and continuous random variables, methods for parameter estimation, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing.","Deep learning, plus the specialized techniques that it has inspired (e.g. convolutional features and word embeddings) have lead to rapid improvements in many applications such as computer vision, machine translation, and computer Go. Coursework includes creating different neural networks (e.g. convolutional, recurrent, n-gram) for image and natural language processing using Numpy and Tensorflow (The primary API for Tensorflow is from Python).","This course treats vision as inference from noisy and uncertain data and emphasizes probabilistic and statistical approaches. Topics may include perception of 3D scene structure from stereo, motion, and shading; segmentation and grouping; texture analysis; learning, object recognition; tracking and motion estimation.","High-level computer architecture and systems programming. The course covers the organization of computer systems (in terms of storage units, caches, processors, and I/O controllers) and teaches students assembly-language programming and C-language programming. Extensive programming exercises introduce students to systems-level programming on Unix systems, as well as to multi-threaded programming with POSIX threads.","An introduction to the basic mathematical ideas and computational methods of optimizing allocation of effort or resources, with or without constraints. Linear programming, network models, dynamic programming, and integer programming.","Basic probabilistic problems and methods in operations research and management science.
